                <p>Grand Theft Auto was the first game in the Grand Theft Auto series of games which was originally released for MS-DOS and Windows-based PCs back in October 1997. In the game, players take control of a criminal who travels freely through the three main cities of the Grand Theft Auto series that have been the subject and settings of subsequent games. These include Liberty City, Vice City, and San Andreas. The missions of Grand Theft Auto are all crime based missions which will have the player take part in criminal activities such as grand theft auto, bank robbery, assault, theft, and more. Players learn of new missions by answering public telephones where crime bosses will detail specific tasks or "jobs" that need to be performed.</p>
                <p>The original Grand Theft Auto, and Grand Theft Auto 2 features two-dimensional graphics with the camera looking down on the action from a bird's eye view of the streets from a few stories above. Like other titles in the series, the game offers freedom to complete missions at the player's leisure, however, the original Grand Theft Auto is somewhat limited and not full sandbox/open style freedom seen in later titles. The primary objective for players is to reach a certain number of points in order to complete a level and move onto the next one. Points are earned by accepting missions from Buddey Seragliano's gang and completing them, the points are also used as money to purchase various items but this takes away from your score and goal for completing levels. Missions also become increasingly difficult as the game progresses, in which case the Grand Theft Auto 1 Cheats and Codes will come in handy for those who are stuck. Grand Theft Auto 1, as it is most commonly referred to now, was released as registered freeware by Rockstar Games in 2004. At the time of this writing, the Rockstar Classics free download series is unavailable, but the game can still be downloaded from various 3rd party sites as detailed in the Grand Theft Auto free PC game page.</p>
