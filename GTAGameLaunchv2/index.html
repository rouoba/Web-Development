          <h3>Grand Theft Auto</h3>
          <p>
            Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is an action-adventure video game series
            created by David Jones and Mike Dailly; the later titles of which
            were created by brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and
            Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by Rockstar North (formerly
            DMA Design), and published by Rockstar Games. The name of the series
            references the term used in the US for motor vehicle theft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most games in the series are set in fictional locales modelled on
            cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which
            are stand-ins for New York City, Miami and the state of California,
            respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities,
            while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay
            focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to
            progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities,
            all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting,
            occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series
            focuses around many different protagonists who attempt to rise
            through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives
            for doing so vary in each game. The series also has elements of the
            earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era.
          </p>
          <p>
            The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the
            protagonist or his organisation, or characters who have the most
            impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Film and music veterans
            have voiced characters, including Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis
            Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Phil Collins,
            Axl Rose and Peter Fonda. With its British origin, the series
            contains satire and humour.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            British video game developer DMA Design began the series in 1997. As
            of 2014, it has eleven stand-alone games and four expansion packs.
            The third chronological title, Grand Theft Auto III, is considered a
            landmark title, as it brought the series to a 3D setting and more
            immersive experience. Subsequent titles would follow and build upon
            the concept established in Grand Theft Auto III, and receive
            significant acclaim. They subsequently influenced many other open
            world action games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on
            similar games.
          </p>
          <p>
            The series has been critically acclaimed and commercially
            successful, having shipped more than 250 million units,[5] making it
            the fourth-highest selling video game franchise of all time, behind
            Nintendo's Mario and Pokémon franchises,[6] and Tetris.[7] In 2006,
            Grand Theft Auto featured in a list of British design icons in the
            Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design
            Museum.[8] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among
            Britain's most successful exports.[4] However, the series has also
            gained controversy for its adult nature and violent themes.
